              <p>
                The pandemic led me to discover crocheting as a therapeutic and
                creative hobby. Crafting intricate patterns with yarn became a
                soothing escape during challenging times, allowing me to create
                beautiful and functional pieces.

              <p>
                My journey into sewing began with a desire to design and sew
                unique clothing for my beloved plushie collection. This newfound
                passion sparked my creativity and allowed me to bring custom
                fashion to my adorable stuffed companions.

              <p>
                I've been a fan of K-pop since my Junior Highschool days, and my
                favorite group, Stray Kids, has consistently captured my heart
                with their music and performances. Their talent and dedication
                continue to inspire my deep appreciation for the K-pop genre.

                Photooshop has been a versatile and enjoyable tool for me,

          If you had asked the 10th-grade version of myself what she wanted to
          study in college, she would probably have hesitated before saying
          BSIT. She knew deep down that she also wanted to pursue psychology.
          But here we are. I am studying my first choice (which is not my first
          choice on some days), BSIT. Since I was a 10th-grade student, I knew
          how hard it was to code because we had an IT-related subject. Since I
          was the only one who owned a computer and had the determination to
          code, I ended up doing all the hard work of coding for our group.
          Probably, it is also because I was the leader of our group. After that
          moment, I realized that the path ahead of me was going to be a long
          journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          I became a STEM student in my senior year in hopes of still pursuing
          psychology. But then I realized that even though I wanted to become a
          psychologist, I felt I would be more successful in IT. So, I promised
          that when time permits, I would return to my old dream and pursue it.
          Until now, I do not know if I chose this path because of what I felt
          or because everyone in my family is in this field, so I should be too.
          But do not take this out of context; I love graphic designing, and
          someday, it is one of the things I want to do as a job. I just have
          those days where I ask myself, "What if I had chosen psychology or
          arts, would I be happy?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you still want to be here? I do not think that this question
          applies to me. I do not have a choice but to stay. I already know that
          no matter which path I choose, those paths will eventually break me.
          Instead of trying to run away, I will have to endure this journey.
          Hear me out. There is nothing wrong with running away, but in my
          situation, I do not think that is the solution, and I cannot complain
          because no one pressured me to take this path. Will it be worth it?
          That is something only the future can tell. Do I think it will be
          worth it? As long as I can engage in the activities I love, I believe
          it will be worth it.
